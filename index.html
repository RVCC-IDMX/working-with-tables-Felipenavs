              <p>It has the same name as their second album during which they started to adopt the "New Wave" style a little bit more and this song is a reflection of that.</p>

              <p>My personal favorite song from Soda Stereo. Like most of their songs, cryptic, vague in meaning but it makes it a really good song.</p>

              <p>The most popular song of their album "Ruido Blanco". The video clip of this song was filmed in an arqueological attraction in Argentina where the lead singer of the group used to vacation with his family.</p>

              <p>Probably the most melancholic song from Soda Stereo. This song has beautiful lyrics talking about a break up in a very deep and sensitive way.</p>

              <p>A very underappriciated song, not very popular, but in my opinion is a great song. It's full of funny lyrics and the rythm is a bit different then the usual Soda Stereo sound.</p>
